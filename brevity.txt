My liege, and madam, to expostulate 
What majesty should be, what duty is, 
What day is day, night night, and time is time, 
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time; 
Therefore, since 
Brevity is the soul of wit
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, 
I will be brief.
Your noble son is mad.
